Covert Communication - Proof of concept - Readme

The program files are desined to be run in bash.
	Start by running the 'receiver.sh' program followed by 'sender.sh' program.

Basic concept of the program:
	The 'sendflag' flag indicates that the sender is ready to send data.
	The 'receiveflag' flag indicates that the receiver has read the data, which allows the sender to send the next bit of data.
	The flags make use of file permissions as the indicative variables.

Sending time calculation:
	The transmission time was measured by the difference 
	between the start time and end time (in nanoseconds).

	(1 second = 10^9 nanoseconds)
	The time taken for transmission is 0.004802991 seconds.

	(Number of bits = 8; bits/second calculation = number of bits/time in seconds).
	The bits per second rate is ~1,665 bits/second.
